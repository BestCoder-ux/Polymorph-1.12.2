## Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential outputs shared by the same ingredients.

### With a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the responsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks or other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.

### Polymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to co-exist regardless of conflicts.
